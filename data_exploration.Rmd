## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
flights <- readRDS(file = "all_flights_clean.Rdata")
flights <- l
rm(l)
View(flights)
flights %>%
  group_by(Airline) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Airline, ave_delay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
flights %>%
  group_by(Origin, Distance) %>%
  summarise(ave_distance = median(Distance, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Origin, Distance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
as.integer(flights$Month)
View(flights)
flights %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Month, ave_delay)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = " ", breaks = c(1:12)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
flights %>%
  group_by(FlightDate) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(FlightDate, ave_delay)) +
  geom_count()
flights %>%
  group_by(FlightDate) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelayMinutes, na.rm = TRUE))
##function sorts by the day of the year, takes the average of all flights on that day, and returns the averaae delay
View(flights)
flights %>%
  group_by(year_day, Airline) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelayMinutes, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year_day, ave_delay)) +
  geom_point()
flights %>%
  group_by(year_day, Airline) %>%
  summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelayMinutes, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Airline, ave_delay)) +
  geom_smooth()
##essential code - creates a vector containing the day of the year of a flight
library(lubridate)
flights$FlightDate<-as.Date(flights$FlightDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
flights$year_day <- yday(flights$FlightDate)     

A <- "Commutair Aka Champlain Enterprises, Inc."
  D <- "DEN"
  O <- "GJT"

  
    flights %>%
      filter(Airline == A, Origin == O, Dest == D, FlightDate == 4/4/22) %>%
      group_by(FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest) %>%
      summarise(ave_delay = mean(DepDelayMinutes, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(FlightDate, ave_delay)) +
      geom_point()
```
For final plot, will need to take average of the three dates - create column that has day / month but no year?
